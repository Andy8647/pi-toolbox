# Changelog

What changed in each released version of pi-toolbox. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-10

### Added

**A collapse anchor row inside expanded tool boxes.** When a tool box is
expanded, the frame now ends with a `(ctrl+o to collapse)` row. With
[pi-starline](https://github.com/Andy8647/pi-starline) installed the row is
clickable (click it to collapse the box again); without Starline it reads as
an ordinary keyboard hint — `ctrl+o` really does collapse the box in Pi.
Set `toolbox.collapseAnchor: false` to opt out of the row entirely.

The anchor row is painted by Starline's `expandHintAction` matching it, so
neither extension needs to know about the other.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Tool boxes stand down when another extension owns the mouse; clicking to
  expand a box is now opt-in rather than the default.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Rounded, status-aware tool box frames with bash highlighting.
- Click a tool box's border to expand just that box.

### Removed

- The fixed-editor-era click-to-expand that required Starline's compositor.
